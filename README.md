# Predict-the-price-of-a-house

#Steps I Followed
#First thing first , we import our libraries and dataset and then we see the head of the data to know how the data looks like .

#Use describe function to see the percentileâ€™s and other key statistics.

#for a good locality a builder opts to make houses which are more than 3 bedrooms,
#which attracts the higher middle class and upper class section of the society

#Visualizing the location of the houses based on latitude and longitude.

#Let us start with , If price is getting affecting by living area of the house or not ?

#The plot that we used above is called scatter plot , 
#scatter plot helps us to see how our data points are scattered and are usually used for two variables.

##we can see more factors affecting the price
#As we can see from all the above representation that many factors are affecting the prices of the house

#a model in statistics which helps us predicts the future based upon past relationship of variables. 
#So when you see your scatter plot being having data points placed linearly you know regression can help you!
